# Aliens!
I'm excited to present my first real Python project! It's a learning
project but, anyway, I'm trying to make it as much fun as possible.
It's a down-scrolling space shooter in which your flyer is faced with
an endless armada of vicious alien ships.

## Goal
Survive as long as you can and make as many points as possible!
Every hit kills you! But don't worry: You have some extra lives
before you go game over. 
Every shot alien ship gives you a base amount of points plus your
current accuracy bonus. The accuracy bonus increases when you hit an
alien but decreases (slowly) whenever one of your bullets misses.

## Controls
With the escape key you can always leave the game. You can steer your
flyer with the arrow keys and shoot with the space bar. The space bar
is also used to start the game or leave the game-over screen.
