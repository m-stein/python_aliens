# Aliens!
I'm excited to present my first real Python project! It's a learning
project but, anyway, I'm trying to make it as much fun as possible.
It's a down-scrolling space shooter in which your flyer is faced with
an endless armada of vicious alien ships.

## Goal
Survive as long as you can and make as many points as possible!
Every hit kills you! But don't worry: You have some extra lives
before you go game over. 
Every shot alien ship gives you a base amount of points plus your
current accuracy bonus. The accuracy bonus increases when you hit an
alien but decreases (slowly) whenever one of your bullets misses.

## Controls
You can steer your flyer with the arrow keys and shoot with the space bar.
The space bar is also used to start the game or leave the game-over screen.
